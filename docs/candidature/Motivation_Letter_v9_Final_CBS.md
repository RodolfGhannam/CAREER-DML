Dear Members of the PhD Admissions Committee,

I am writing to express my profound interest in the PhD program at Copenhagen Business School, specifically within the research area of "Digital Transformations" under the supervision of Prof. Kongsted. My academic background in econometrics and my professional experience have culminated in a deep commitment to understanding the causal impacts of technological change on labor markets. I have already developed a fully-functional research framework, CAREER-DML, and I believe CBS is the ideal environment to scale this work from a validated proof-of-concept to a series of impactful, publishable papers.

My initial research, conducted in a **semi-synthetic data laboratory calibrated with real-world US labor market data (NLSY79 and Felten et al., 2021)**, yielded two key insights that form the basis of my PhD proposal. First, I documented a **"Sequential Embedding Ordering Phenomenon,"** an empirical finding where simpler predictive models consistently outperformed more complex, causally-motivated models in this specific domain. Second, I characterized a **"Signal-to-Noise Frontier,"** which formally demonstrates that detecting realistic, small-magnitude wage effects requires sample sizes far larger than what is commonly available in survey data.

This is precisely why I am applying to CBS. My project has reached a scientifically productive limit. The external review of my work was exceptionally positive, concluding that my framework is "intelectualmente ambicioso, metodologicamente sólido e tecnicamente consistente." The reviewer's suggestions for future work—exploring dynamic treatment effects and expanding the dialogue with structural economics—are not weaknesses of my current project, but rather a perfect description of my proposed PhD agenda. Each limitation of my current work is a powerful motivation for the next step, a step that can only be taken with the resources available at CBS.

The Danish administrative registers provide the scale (N > 1M) and temporal depth (T > 30 years) necessary to cross the Signal-to-Noise Frontier and unlock the full potential of the CAREER-DML framework. My research proposal outlines a clear, three-year plan to leverage these resources to not only provide robust, large-scale estimates of the returns to AI exposure but also to investigate the conditions under which the Embedding Ordering Phenomenon holds and to explore the dynamic nature of these effects over the life-cycle.

I am confident that my proven technical skills, combined with the mature research agenda born from the productive limitations of my current work, make me a strong candidate for your program. I am eager to contribute to the vibrant research community at CBS and to learn from the world-leading scholars in your department. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Rodolf Mikel Ghannam Neto
