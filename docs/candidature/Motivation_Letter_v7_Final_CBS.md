Dear Members of the Admissions Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the PhD program at the Department of Strategy and Innovation. My ambition is to research the causal effects of AI on worker careers, and I believe my background, validated research framework, and specific focus on large-scale empirical questions make me a strong candidate for your program and, specifically, for supervision by Professor H.C. Kongsted and Professor Tom Grad.

My research has been driven by a single question: how can we move beyond correlation to understand the true causal impact of AI on individual careers? To answer this, I have spent the last year developing **CAREER-DML**, a causal machine learning framework that uses career sequence embeddings within a Double/Debiased Machine Learning pipeline. This was not a simple exercise; it was a rigorous process of building, testing, validating, and iterating through multiple versions. The process yielded two findings that now motivate my application to CBS.

First, I discovered the **Embedding Paradox**: the counterintuitive but robust finding that standard predictive models outperform theoretically-motivated causal models (specifically, the VIB approach of Veitch et al. 2020) in our DML pipeline for career data. This result holds even after controlling for model dimensionality, suggesting a fundamental limitation of information bottleneck methods for sequential occupational data. Second, and more importantly, I identified the **Signal-to-Noise Frontier**: the empirical limit where, for realistic effect sizes, the signal of a causal effect is drowned out by selection bias in typical datasets. This discovery is not a setback; it is the very foundation of my proposal. It provides the empirical justification for why the next essential step is to apply this framework to population-scale administrative data — precisely the kind of data that is a hallmark of research at CBS.

My proposal is therefore not to *start* a project, but to *scale* one. The framework is already built, validated, and benchmarked, demonstrating an 88-95% bias reduction over classical methods. I am now seeking the right environment and the right data to take it further. The access to Danish register data at CBS, combined with the department's expertise in both strategy and econometrics, provides the ideal setting for this next phase.

I am particularly drawn to the work of my proposed supervisors. Professor Kongsted's extensive experience with Danish register data and labor mobility is directly relevant to the empirical application of my framework. Professor Grad's research on human-machine rivalry provides the theoretical lens through which I aim to interpret my findings. The synergy between my validated methodological framework and their domain expertise would, I believe, lead to productive research.

My CV reflects a career dedicated to leading teams and delivering complex projects. I have the technical skills, the project management experience, and the academic preparation to execute this research agenda. I am confident that my work can contribute to the department's research on the future of work.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my full research proposal and look forward to the possibility of discussing my work with you further.

Sincerely,

Rodolf Mikel Ghannam Neto
