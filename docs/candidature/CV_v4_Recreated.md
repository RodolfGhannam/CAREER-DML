## Professional Experience

**Corporate Director**
Grupo CICAL, Goiania, Brazil | 2017 to Present

Grupo CICAL is a diversified conglomerate with over 1,800 employees operating across the automotive, real estate, financial services, and insurance sectors. As Corporate Director, responsibilities include:

Strategic leadership and operational oversight across all business units, including P&L responsibility for the group's diversified portfolio. Direct management of Marketing teams and brand strategy across all divisions.

Registered representative of Cical Consorcio with the Central Bank of Brazil (Banco Central do Brasil), responsible for regulatory compliance and the oversight of a financial product (consorcio) that requires strict adherence to central bank regulations. Maintained a **zero-deficiency compliance record across 40 consecutive quarterly audits over 10 years**. This role alternates with a peer corporate director for national and international group representation.

Direct negotiation with national and international insurance companies, including HDI Seguros, Tokio Marine, Azul Seguros, and Yellow/Liberty Seguros, managing complex multi-year contracts and risk portfolios.

Pioneered 4 digital transformation projects (post-2022) that positioned Grupo CICAL as a first-mover among Brazilian automotive dealership groups, exploring digital fields unprecedented in the sector at the time. Designed and implemented a proprietary **5-stage digital customer service methodology**: (1) Research — data-driven diagnosis of service gaps using digital analytics; (2) Model — creation of tailored training frameworks and KPI dashboards; (3) Implement — deployment of AI-powered tools for real-time customer interaction tracking; (4) Group Training — post-implementation collective workshops to build shared competencies across teams; (5) Monitor, Accompany & Individualize — through continuous performance tracking, **heterogeneous needs naturally emerged** among employees, requiring the training approach to evolve from group-level into **personalized coaching** tailored to each collaborator's specific gaps and strengths. This adaptive approach — where individualization is not pre-designed but emerges organically from data-driven accompaniment — led the group to achieve the **GM "A" Excellence Award for 4 consecutive years** (General Motors' highest dealership distinction) and equivalent top-tier recognitions from other OEM brands. Integrated AI-powered tools across operations, customer service, and marketing. Key measurable outcomes: **89% client retention rate** in the insurance portfolio and **70% year-over-year revenue growth** in the insurance division. This practitioner experience — designing iterative human-AI training systems at scale — is the direct inspiration for the proposed PhD research on AI adoption and career trajectories.

**Marketing Director**
Grupo CICAL, Goiania, Brazil | 2015 to 2017

Responsible for the strategic direction of all marketing operations across the group's business units, including brand positioning, digital marketing, customer acquisition, and campaign management across automotive, real estate, financial services, and insurance divisions.

**Founder and CEO**
Real Alimentos LTDA, Goiania, Brazil | 2002 to 2014

Founded and scaled a food distribution company from inception to a national supplier. Key achievements include:

Created the brand identity, packaging design, and product line from scratch. Built and managed the entire supply chain and distribution network.

Secured contracts as a direct supplier to Brazil's largest retail chains: Walmart, Carrefour, Sam's Club, and Pao de Acucar (GPA Group). This required navigating complex procurement processes, quality certifications, and large-scale logistics.

## Research Project (PhD Candidacy)

**"Human-Machine Rivalry in Career Trajectories: A Causal Machine Learning Approach Using Danish Register Data"**

This project develops a novel causal inference framework combining Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DML) with Career Embeddings (GRU neural networks) to estimate the heterogeneous causal effect of AI exposure on career trajectories. The project proposes two original theoretical contributions: the "Data Generation Effect" (a feedback mechanism where human labor generates training data for the AI rival) and the "Embedding Paradox" (the finding that embeddings can worsen average effect estimation while being essential for discovering heterogeneity).

A fully functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) has been developed, featuring a synthetic data laboratory for method validation, four embedding variants (Predictive, Causal VIB, Debiased Adversarial, Two-Stage Causal), CausalForestDML estimation, and a comprehensive validation suite (variance decomposition, placebo tests, Oster bounds). The Predictive GRU achieved an ATE of 0.5378 against a true ATE of 0.50 (SE: 0.0520, 95% CI: [0.4358, 0.6397], p < 10⁻²⁴), passing placebo tests (ATEs of -0.0478 and 0.0139, both ≈0), and yielding a 93.0% bias reduction relative to the properly-identified Heckman Two-Step model. A causal sufficiency test (Veitch et al., 2020) and linear representation probing provide additional diagnostics on the information content of each embedding variant. The MVP source code and technical blueprint are available as an appendix to this application.
