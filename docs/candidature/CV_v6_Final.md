## Profile

Executive and practitioner-researcher with over 15 years of leadership experience in corporate strategy and finance. My career has been defined by a transition from traditional management to data-driven, quantitative problem-solving. While directing operations for a diversified conglomerate, I designed a proprietary 5-stage customer service methodology whose AI-powered analytics revealed significant heterogeneity in employee development needs—forcing a strategic shift from group training to personalized coaching. This field-based discovery of heterogeneous treatment effects is the direct inspiration for my PhD research. I now seek to formalize this practical experience with the academic rigor of the PhD program at CBS, contributing to the **'Digital Transformations'** research area by developing causal machine learning methods to study the heterogeneous effects of AI adoption on career trajectories.

## Research & Applied AI Projects

### PhD Candidacy Project: CAREER-DML

Developed **CAREER-DML**, a novel framework for causal inference on career trajectories, designed to bridge the **two cultures of modern econometrics**—causal ML and structural modeling. The framework was validated on a semi-synthetic DGP calibrated with real-world US labor market data (NLSY79 and Felten et al. 2021 AIOE scores).

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Sequential Embedding Ordering Phenomenon:** Documented a robust empirical finding, observed across three distinct scenarios, that challenges the direct application of some causal representation learning methods to this domain.
2. **Signal-to-Noise Frontier:** Characterized the sample size requirements for detecting realistic effect sizes (N > 1,034 for ATE = 0.08), providing a rigorous justification for the use of large-scale administrative data.
3. **Structural Bridge:** Built an explicit conceptual bridge to the structural econometrics tradition, showing how the learned embeddings serve as non-parametric analogs of classical latent variables (Ben-Porath, Mincer, Autor, Keane & Wolpin).

**Validation:** The framework outperforms classical methods like Heckman selection models, **reducing estimation bias by an order of magnitude (from 945% to under 60%)**. Fully implemented and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RodolfGhannam/CAREER-DML).

### MIT Capstone Project: AI Triage System

Designed an AI-powered triage support system for hospital emergency rooms. A simulated pilot study (N=1,200) demonstrated the potential to reduce patient wait times by 40% and deliver a projected 28:1 ROI. Achieved a 100% score on the final capstone.

## Professional Experience

**Corporate Director** | Grupo CICAL, Goiânia, Brazil (2017 – Present)

Directed corporate strategy for a diversified conglomerate spanning automotive, real estate, and financial services. Served as a registered representative with the Central Bank of Brazil for the consortium division (Cical Consórcio), personally signing and responding to 40+ consecutive quarterly audits with a perfect compliance record. Represented the group in negotiations with global insurers (HDI Seguros, Tokio Marine, Yellow/Liberty, Azul) and led marketing operations across all business units.

As a practitioner-researcher, designed and implemented a proprietary **5-stage data-driven customer service methodology** (Research, Model, Implement, Train, Individualize). The system's AI-powered analytics revealed significant **heterogeneous development needs** among employees, forcing a strategic shift from group training to personalized coaching. This experience of discovering and acting on heterogeneity in the field is the direct inspiration for my PhD research.

**Marketing Director** | Grupo CICAL, Goiânia, Brazil (2015 – 2017)

Led strategic marketing operations, including market analysis, brand strategy, and performance analytics across all business units.

**Founder & CEO** | Real Alimentos Ltda, Goiânia, Brazil (2002 – 2014)

Founded and scaled a food distribution company from the ground up, including brand creation and packaging design. Secured national supply contracts with Brazil's largest retail chains, including Walmart, Carrefour, Sam's Club, and Pão de Açúcar.
