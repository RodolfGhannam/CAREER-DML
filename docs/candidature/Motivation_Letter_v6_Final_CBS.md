Dear Members of the Selection Committee,

For twenty years, I have led companies through technological disruption. But since 2016, when I joined Brazil's Escola Superior de Guerra (ESG)—our equivalent of the NATO Defence College—my focus has shifted. The strategic studies we conducted on national challenges led me to consider how my skills could contribute beyond the corporate sphere. The rise of AI has given me the tools to pursue this interest with academic rigour, and I see the Copenhagen Business School as the right environment to do so.

My research proposal, **"Human-Machine Rivalry in Career Trajectories,"** is born from the urgency to move beyond documenting **what** is happening to understanding **why** and **for whom**. It introduces the concept of the **"Data Generation Effect"** as a key theoretical contribution to explain these dynamics. It is a direct response to your department's research priorities on **Competitive Dynamics** (#2) and **AI & Digital Transformation** (#10), and it draws on a set of quantitative tools I have developed over the past year. I have built a full-stack DML pipeline with four embedding variants, validated it in a **synthetic data laboratory** with formal statistical inference and causal sufficiency diagnostics, and used it to generate the **Career Embeddings** that form the core of my proposal. **A fully functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is available as an appendix to this application.**

I am drawn to CBS, and specifically to the work of Prof. Tom Grad and Prof. H.C. Kongsted, because of the alignment between your research and my proposal. Prof. Grad's work on rivalry provides a relevant theoretical framework for analysing the competitive dynamics of the AI-driven workplace. Prof. Kongsted's work on R&D labour mobility using Danish register data provides the empirical foundation and methodological guidance for applying our framework to real career trajectories. My goal is to extend these frameworks, using our synthetic laboratory to develop methods that can then be applied to the comprehensive Danish register data to identify the causal mechanisms that shape career outcomes in this context.

I am not a traditional candidate. I am a practitioner-researcher who has built brands, negotiated with global insurers, and led a 1,800-person conglomerate. At Grupo CICAL, I designed a proprietary 5-stage digital customer service methodology—Research, Model, Implement, Group Training, Monitor & Individualize—where AI-powered analytics revealed **heterogeneous development needs** among employees, requiring the training to evolve from group-level into personalized coaching. This system earned the **GM "A" Excellence Award for 4 consecutive years**. This is not just a professional achievement; it is the lived experience that drives my PhD research. I observed in the field exactly what Heckman theorizes: that human capital forms differently across individuals, and that understanding this heterogeneity is the key to effective intervention. I have also invested deeply in the quantitative and computational skills required for this PhD—the enclosed MVP demonstrates that career embeddings serve as a robust nonparametric alternative to classical selection correction. Across four embedding variants—including a faithful implementation of the two-stage procedure in Veitch et al. (2020)—the Predictive GRU achieves an ATE of 0.5378 against a true ATE of 0.50 (SE: 0.0520, 95% CI: [0.4358, 0.6397], p < 10⁻²⁴), representing a **93.0% bias reduction** over the properly-identified Heckman two-step model. A formal GATES heterogeneity test (t = 62.27, p < 10⁻²⁰⁰) confirms skill-biased treatment effects, and a systematic VIB sensitivity analysis, causal sufficiency test, and linear representation probing address the theoretical critique of Veitch et al. (2020). This is the proof-of-concept that accompanies this application, and it reflects my preparation to contribute to the department's research programme.

This transition from practice to research has been a long-considered decision, guided by a belief best captured by Ayrton Senna: *"Always have as a goal a lot of strength, a lot of determination, and always do everything with a lot of love and a lot of faith in God, that one day you will get there."*

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Rodolf Mikel Ghannam Neto
