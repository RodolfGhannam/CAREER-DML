## 1. Profile

Business executive and practitioner-researcher with over 15 years of experience in corporate strategy and finance for a R$1B revenue conglomerate. My professional work has centered on designing quantitative systems to solve practical business problems, where I repeatedly encountered the challenge of isolating causal impacts in complex observational data. This experience directly motivates my pursuit of a PhD to develop and apply rigorous causal machine learning methods to fundamental questions in strategy and labor economics, focusing on the heterogeneous effects of AI adoption on career trajectories. My research is a perfect fit for the **'Digital Transformations'** research area at CBS.

## 3. Research & Applied AI Projects

### **PhD Candidacy Project: CAREER-DML**

- **Contribution:** Developed **CAREER-DML**, a novel framework for causal inference on career trajectories, designed to bridge the **two cultures of modern econometrics**—causal ML and structural modeling. The framework was validated on a semi-synthetic DGP calibrated with real-world US labor market data (NLSY79).
- **Key Findings & Contributions:**
    1. **Sequential Embedding Ordering Phenomenon:** Documented a robust empirical finding that challenges the direct application of some causal representation learning methods to this domain.
    2. **Signal-to-Noise Frontier:** Characterized the sample size requirements for detecting realistic effect sizes, providing a rigorous justification for the use of large-scale administrative data.
    3. **Structural Bridge:** Built an explicit conceptual bridge to the structural econometrics tradition (Ben-Porath, Mincer, Autor, Keane & Wolpin).
- **Validation:** The framework outperforms classical methods like Heckman selection models, **reducing estimation bias by an order of magnitude (from 945% to under 60%)**. The project is fully implemented and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/RodolfGhannam/CAREER-DML).

### **MIT Capstone Project: AI Triage System**

- Designed an AI-powered triage support system for hospital emergency rooms. A simulated pilot study (N=1,200) demonstrated the potential to reduce patient wait times by 40% and deliver a projected 28:1 ROI.

## 4. Professional Experience

**Corporate Director** | Grupo CICAL, Goiânia, Brazil (2017 – Present)

- Directed strategy for a diversified conglomerate (1,800+ employees) across automotive, real estate, and financial services. Held P&L responsibility and served as a registered representative with the Central Bank of Brazil, maintaining a perfect compliance record across 40+ consecutive quarterly audits.
- As a practitioner-researcher, I pioneered digital transformation projects, including the design and implementation of a proprietary **5-stage data-driven customer service methodology** (Research, Model, Implement, Train, Individualize). The system's AI-powered analytics revealed significant **heterogeneous development needs** among employees, forcing a strategic shift from group training to personalized coaching. This experience of discovering and acting on heterogeneity in the field is the direct inspiration for my PhD research.
- Developed quantitative risk models (regression, forecasting) to support high-stakes negotiations with global insurers (HDI, Tokio Marine), structuring multi-year financial guarantees.

**Marketing Director** | Grupo CICAL, Goiânia, Brazil (2015 – 2017)

- Led strategic marketing operations, including market analysis and performance analytics, across all business units.

**Founder & CEO** | Real Alimentos Ltda, Goiânia, Brazil (2002 – 2014)

- Founded and scaled a food distribution company, securing national supply contracts with Brazil's largest retail chains, including Walmart, Carrefour, and Sam's Club.
