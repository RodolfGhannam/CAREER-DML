Dear Members of the Selection Committee,

For twenty years, I have led companies through technological disruption. But since 2016, when I joined Brazil's Escola Superior de Guerra (ESG)—our equivalent of the NATO Defence College—my focus has shifted. The strategic studies we conducted on national challenges ignited in me a deep-seated desire to use my skills not just for corporate success, but for the common good. The rise of AI has now given me the tools to pursue this ambition with academic rigor, and I am incredibly excited by the prospect of doing so at the Copenhagen Business School.

The stakes have never been higher. A recent landmark study by Brynjolfsson, Chandar, and Chen (2025) from the Stanford Digital Economy Lab documented a **16% relative employment decline for early-career workers in AI-exposed occupations** within just three years. These "canaries in the coal mine" confirm that the disruption is not a distant forecast; it is happening now, and it is disproportionately affecting those at the start of their careers. My research proposal, **"Human-Machine Rivalry in Career Trajectories,"** is born from the urgency to move beyond documenting **what** is happening to understanding **why** and **for whom**. It introduces the concept of the **"Data Generation Effect"** as a key theoretical contribution to explain these dynamics. It is a direct response to your department's research priorities on **Competitive Dynamics** (#2) and **AI & Digital Transformation** (#10), and it is fueled by a powerful set of tools I have worked hard to master. I am not just proposing to study Causal Machine Learning; I have built a full-stack DML pipeline, validated it in a **synthetic data laboratory**, and used it to generate the **Career Embeddings** that form the core of my proposal. **A fully functional Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is available as an appendix to this application.**

I am drawn to CBS, and specifically to the work of Prof. Tom Grad and Prof. H.C. Kongsted, because you are asking the right questions. Prof. Grad's research on rivalry provides the perfect theoretical lens through which to analyze the new competitive dynamics of the AI-driven workplace. Prof. Kongsted's pioneering work on R&D labor mobility using Danish register data provides the ideal empirical foundation and methodological guidance for applying our validated framework to real career trajectories. My goal is to extend these frameworks, using my proposed synthetic laboratory to develop methods that can then be deployed on the unparalleled Danish register data to uncover the causal mechanisms that determine who thrives and who falters in this new era.

I am not a traditional candidate. I am a practitioner-researcher who has built brands, negotiated with global insurers, and led a 1,800-person conglomerate. At Grupo CICAL, I designed a proprietary 5-stage digital customer service methodology—Research, Model, Implement, Group Training, Monitor & Individualize—where AI-powered analytics revealed **heterogeneous development needs** among employees, requiring the training to evolve from group-level into personalized coaching. This system earned the **GM "A" Excellence Award for 4 consecutive years**. This is not just a professional achievement; it is the lived experience that drives my PhD research. I observed in the field exactly what Heckman theorizes: that human capital forms differently across individuals, and that understanding this heterogeneity is the key to effective intervention. I have also invested deeply in the quantitative and computational skills required for this PhD—the enclosed MVP, with its Debiased GRU achieving an ATE of 0.413 (bias: -0.087), is my proof of concept and my commitment that I am ready to contribute to your department's vital work from day one.

This journey is not just a career change; it is the culmination of a decade-long ambition, driven by a belief best captured by Ayrton Senna: *"Always have as a goal a lot of strength, a lot of determination, and always do everything with a lot of love and a lot of faith in God, that one day you will get there."*

I am ready to get there. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Rodolf Mikel Ghannam Neto
